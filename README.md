## Quick start

You need [Node.js 18.17+](https://nodejs.org/) and one of the following: an API key, an authenticated [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), or an authenticated [Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview).

```bash
npm install -g penecho
penecho configure
penecho
```

Interactive starts print the current version immediately. After the server is listening, PenEcho displays `Checking latest PenEcho version...` and queries npm without delaying availability. If a newer version exists, press Enter at the default `Y` prompt to install it globally. The current service then stops without launching a background process; run `penecho` again when you are ready to start the updated version. When the installed version is current, PenEcho says so explicitly. Offline checks and non-interactive starts continue without blocking the running service.

`penecho configure` opens the interactive configuration center. Its main menu contains `LLM source`, `Settings`, and `Exit`. Use the arrow keys and Enter to navigate:

- `LLM source -> Claude CLI` selects a detected, recommended, default, or manually entered model and an effort level. Opus 4.8 or newer is recommended; Sonnet and Opus 4.6 can respond but may produce weaker canvas results.
- `LLM source -> Codex CLI` selects a model and effort. GPT-5.5 or newer is required for good results, `gpt-5.6-sol` is recommended, and `xhigh` is the highest listed Codex effort.
- `LLM source -> API` selects the OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic/Claude-compatible request format, then asks for the URL, model, effort, and hidden key. Kimi K3 ([China](https://platform.kimi.com?aff=penecho) / [Global](https://platform.kimi.ai?aff=penecho)) uses the OpenAI-compatible format with model `k3`; current testing recommends `medium`. Anthropic API offers `none` to disable thinking and defaults new configurations to the recommended `medium` adaptive-thinking level. PenEcho does not set `temperature` for API requests, connection checks, or CLI invocations; each provider and model uses its own default. Existing values are offered as defaults and a blank key keeps the saved key.
- `Settings` controls the unified model timeout, the image format sent to every model executor, request recording and retention, listening interface and port, and initial Auto AI delay. WebP is the default; PNG is also available. The delay can also be changed on the canvas.

Every LLM page ends with `Test & Save`, and PenEcho always saves before checking. Codex CLI uses a fast offline check: it verifies the executable and login, then reads `codex debug models --bundled` to confirm the selected model exists. It does not run inference, attach an image, refresh the online catalog, or consume model tokens. Claude CLI and API configuration still send one small real request to verify the selected endpoint/model settings. Whether a check passes or fails, the configuration remains saved and the UI returns to the parent menu with a clear diagnostic.

The canvas toolbar exposes a fixed-width clickable `Reasoning` menu beside Auto AI for frequent per-request changes: `Configured`, `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and the provider's highest practical level. `Configured` omits the per-request effort field so the server preserves the configured custom effort or the underlying CLI default. The last explicit position maps to `xhigh` for OpenAI API and Codex CLI, and to `max` for Anthropic API and Claude CLI. `none` sends OpenAI `reasoning_effort=none`; for Claude it disables thinking. Model support remains provider-dependent, so an endpoint may reject a level its selected model does not implement. The saved `AI_EFFORT` initializes this control, while a toolbar change overrides it for subsequent canvas requests without rewriting the configuration file. The menu closes after a selection or five seconds of inactivity.

The default configuration is `~/.penecho/config.env`. API credentials are plaintext in this local file, receive owner-only permissions on POSIX systems, and are never sent to browser code. Protect it like any other credential. If `penecho` is started before this file exists, it opens the configuration center automatically in an interactive terminal.

Use a different env-style configuration file for a particular launch when needed:

```bash
penecho configure --config ./team.env
penecho --config ./team.env
```

An explicit `--config` file replaces the default global file for that command. PenEcho does not automatically read a project-directory `.env` or a package-directory `.env`.

### CLI prerequisites

Installing the Codex desktop app alone does not guarantee that a `codex` executable is available on the shell `PATH`. Install and authenticate the CLI separately before selecting Codex:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex@latest
hash -r
codex --version
codex login status
```

If needed, run `codex login`. Claude CLI mode similarly requires an installed and authenticated Claude Code CLI, normally through `claude auth login`.

PenEcho uses the selected CLI locally and does not need an API key for that source. Normal startup checks the executable and login without consuming model tokens. Codex `Test & Save` additionally verifies the selected model against the installed CLI's bundled catalog without making a model request; Claude `Test & Save` sends a small real request.

Canvas requests through Codex use `codex exec --json`. PenEcho returns as soon as Codex emits the final agent message and `turn.completed`; if the CLI process remains alive afterward, it is terminated and cleaned up in the background instead of delaying the canvas response.

Claude CLI requests use one isolated `claude -p` turn with tools, agents, MCP, prompt suggestions, session persistence, and other nonessential background traffic disabled. Selecting effort `none` sets `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0`, causing Claude Code to send `thinking.type=disabled`; because `none` is not a valid Claude CLI effort value, PenEcho also passes an internal `low` effort and per-process `--settings` override to neutralize any user-level `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL=max`. Selecting `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `max` leaves thinking enabled and applies the chosen value through both Claude's `--effort` flag and the same settings override. PenEcho incrementally validates the stream and returns as soon as Claude emits its successful final `result`; any attempted tool use aborts the request, while a CLI process that remains alive after the result is terminated and cleaned up in the background.

Transient launch overrides remain available:

```bash
penecho doctor --codex
penecho --codex --model gpt-5.6-sol --effort xhigh
penecho --claude --model opus --effort max
penecho --port 4000
```

`--model`, `--effort`, and `--port` apply only to that process and take precedence over the selected configuration file. Omit them to use the saved choice or the underlying CLI default. Other model-specific effort strings are accepted and passed through.

### Run from this source directory

Install dependencies and start this checkout through the same production entry point as the installed CLI:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The first interactive start opens the configuration center when needed. Arguments after `--` are passed to PenEcho, for example `npm start -- --port 4000`.

To expose this checkout's `penecho` command globally instead, use:

```bash
npm link
penecho configure
penecho
```

`npm link` creates the local command link; it does not publish the package. There is no separate build step.

Open [http://localhost:3888](http://localhost:3888). With the default `0.0.0.0` listener, startup also prints the machine's concrete LAN URLs on the following lines. Open one of those URLs on another device; if it cannot connect, allow the configured inbound TCP port in the host operating system's firewall or applicable routing policy.

## Think on the canvas

Put a question, equation, diagram, or half-formed idea anywhere on the canvas and pause. PenEcho reads your marks and their spatial relationships, then answers beside them. You can work through a problem without translating every step into a chat message or rebuilding it with rigid diagram tools.

- Get answers, hints, explanations, continuations, formulas, plots, and diagrams directly on the canvas.
- Drag AI drafts directly on the canvas, resize them by group or axis, copy returned text or formulas, then accept or discard them before they become part of your work.
- Draw naturally with a stylus or mouse, then pan and zoom across a sparse `20,000 x 20,000` canvas.
- Draw a freehand lasso around confirmed ink to move, resize, recolor, delete, or send only that selection to Typeset; ordinary selection edits and cancellation never trigger an AI request.
- Choose Arcane, Sci-fi, Research, or Studio mode to match the kind of problem you are exploring.
- Save lightweight snapshots locally in your browser. Starting a new canvas can overwrite the current snapshot, save a new copy, or continue without saving; unconfirmed AI drafts are never included.
- Export confirmed canvas ink as a cropped PNG with one `512`-pixel tile of paper margin on every side.

PenEcho keeps a small local runtime and only allocates `512 x 512` tiles where ink exists, so the huge logical canvas does not become a huge bitmap.

## What's new in 0.7.0

- **Live, interactive HTML on the canvas.** The new General HTML plugin lets the model build focused clocks, calculators, dashboards, and other responsive interfaces as sandboxed canvas widgets. Widget content remains directly interactive; long-press switches into canvas editing for moving, resizing, confirming, or deleting it.
- **Useful data without a PenEcho data service.** Focused plugins cover weather, stocks, technology news, exchange rates, earthquakes, natural events, space weather, and GitHub activity. Requests go directly from the user's browser to each declared API origin; PenEcho does not proxy or cache plugin data.
- **Explicit security boundaries.** Every data plugin declares its allowed `connect` origins. Widget networking is restricted to that allowlist, HTML runs in an isolated iframe, and disabled plugins contribute no prompt, payload, message hook, or widget runtime behavior.
- **Local plugin creation.** A compact Markdown format combines metadata, runtime rules, and required one-shot examples in a prompt budget of roughly 1,000 tokens or less. The Preview creator can improve a draft with AI, fill its title, save and enable it locally, and delete personal plugins later; personal and built-in plugins stay clearly separated in the catalog.
- **Canvas-native persistence and export.** Confirmed widgets participate in local snapshots and PNG export. Width and height handles reflow the interface without scaling its text, while the corner handle scales the whole widget like an image; deletion remains undoable.
- **Sensible defaults.** General HTML, Animation scenes, and Weather start enabled for new users. All other data plugins remain opt-in, and every choice is remembered locally.

## What's new in 0.6.0

- **Controllable animated explanations.** Declarative animation scenes are enabled by default so the model can use motion when explicitly requested or when it materially improves an explanation. The generic Plugins menu can turn them off, removing the additional 500–600 prompt tokens and restoring the original request and rendering behavior.
- **Safe, persistent animation rendering.** Transparent Canvas2D scenes support up to 32 objects and 32 motions, play immediately, remain editable before and after confirmation, and persist through snapshots. The renderer uses a separate transparent layer with dirty-region updates, limits the canvas to 20 animations, and never executes model-provided JavaScript.
- **Touch- and pen-friendly animation controls.** Mouse and pen clicks reveal the full animation toolbar immediately, while touch requires a one-second hold to avoid accidental activation during canvas panning. The toolbar and selection outline hide together after ten seconds, an outside click, or renewed drawing.
- **More reliable model output.** Requests reserve output headroom, animation dimensions are bounded without encouraging oversized scenes, and the server can recover the first complete JSON response from harmless trailing model output. Invalid, incomplete, disabled, or over-limit animation commands remain rejected explicitly.
- **Sharper text and draft rendering.** Confirmed text automatically formats safe Markdown and likely LaTeX, with Preview showing the same final result. Large downsampled AI drafts now clip against their logical dimensions, preventing the initial top-left-quarter rendering defect.
- **Non-blocking npm updates.** Interactive starts bring the service online before checking npm, visibly report the installed version, and stop cleanly after an accepted global update so the upgraded service can be started manually.

## Animation scenes in 0.6.0

Animation is a removable plugin rather than a permanent requirement for every PenEcho request. `Animation scenes` is enabled by default in the canvas toolbar's `Plugins` menu. Clear its checkbox whenever you want the original static request and canvas behavior; PenEcho remembers that choice.

- **When enabled:** the model may return an animated demonstration when you explicitly request one or when motion materially clarifies the answer. The additional animation protocol adds approximately `500–600` input tokens to each AI request.
- **When disabled:** PenEcho omits the animation protocol and plugin field, filters new animation commands, and does not render animation scenes. Static requests and canvas behavior remain the same as before this feature. Previously saved scenes remain stored and become available again if the plugin is re-enabled.
- **Transparent by design:** animation scenes have no background layer, allowing the paper, handwriting, diagrams, and other canvas content underneath to remain visible.

For example, with the plugin enabled, you can write or ask for an animated orbital model, a moving geometry construction, interacting figures, or another process where change over time is part of the explanation. The model is instructed to choose a size that fits the actual request; `5000` logical units per axis is an upper bound, not a target.

Returned scenes start playing while they are still editable drafts. Move or resize the draft, then accept or discard it like other AI output. After confirmation:

- Click with a mouse or pen to reveal the complete editing controls immediately.
- Touch and hold for one second to reveal them without interfering with ordinary one-finger canvas panning.
- Use the controls to pause or resume, restart, move, resize, confirm an edit, cancel an edit, or delete the scene.
- The toolbar, outline, and resize controls hide together after about ten seconds, an outside click, canvas navigation, a tool change, or a new pen stroke.

Animation scenes are declarative JSON data rendered by PenEcho's own Canvas2D renderer; model-provided JavaScript is never executed. Each scene is limited to `32` objects and `32` motions, and a canvas can contain at most `20` animations. Only visible playing scenes request animation frames, complex visible scenes reduce their refresh rate, and changed screen regions are redrawn independently. Confirmed scenes and playback state are preserved in local snapshots, and enabled animations are captured at a fixed frame in previews, exports, and later model context.

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/how-it-works-dark.svg">
    <img alt="How PenEcho works: canvas ink becomes a visual atlas, the server routes it to the configured executor, and a structured editable draft returns to the canvas" src="docs/assets/how-it-works-light.svg">
  </picture>
</p>

The browser sends only the relevant canvas crop and geometry. The server validates the request, uses the selected executor, and returns a movable draft that stays separate from confirmed ink until you accept it.

## Recommended model configurations

These recommendations balance answer quality against the latency of PenEcho's real canvas workload. They are based on current hands-on testing rather than synthetic benchmarks; actual response time still varies with the provider, canvas complexity, image size, and reasoning behavior.

| Model | Effort | Quality and speed | Recommended use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude-opus-4-8` | `medium` | Strong quality with a better latency balance | Recommended Opus default for everyday canvas work |
| `claude-opus-4-8` | `high` | Higher reasoning quality, with longer and more variable waits | Complex handwriting, mathematics, diagrams, or layout decisions where quality matters more than speed |
| Fable 5 (`claude-fable-5` or `fable`) | `medium` | Very good results; in current tests, often around half the response time of `gpt-5.6-sol` at `xhigh` | A fast, high-quality general-purpose choice |
| [Kimi K3](https://platform.kimi.ai?aff=penecho) (`k3`) | `medium` | Very good quality in the current comparison; `medium` keeps the quality/speed balance practical | Recommended Kimi/API default for demanding canvas work |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | `low` to `high` | Surprisingly strong and responsive; current PenEcho canvas tests produced better results than `gpt-5.6-sol` with fast response times | Recommended OpenAI option across a flexible range of quality and latency targets |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | `xhigh` | Very good canvas results with strong response speed | A responsive quality-first option when `xhigh` reasoning is appropriate |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | `high` | Good enough for most requests and more responsive than `xhigh` | Recommended Sol default when responsiveness matters |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | `xhigh` | Very good results, but slower and more variable | Quality-first Sol configuration for difficult canvas tasks |

Google models have not been tested yet. Contributions are welcome: if you try Gemini or another Google model, please share the model ID, provider or executor, reasoning configuration, approximate latency, and a representative canvas example in an issue.

## Token use and cost

For a typical PenEcho canvas request, total output usage—including hidden reasoning tokens when the provider reports them—roughly follows the selected effort level:

| Effort | Typical output usage | Practical guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `low` | Around `1,000` tokens | Usually enough for most everyday canvas requests |
| `medium` | Around `3,000` tokens | More reasoning headroom for recognition, mathematics, diagrams, and layout |
| `xhigh` or `max` | Around `5,000–8,000` tokens | Common for quality-first `gpt-5.6-sol` and other maximum-effort requests; expect higher latency and cost |

These are practical estimates rather than enforced PenEcho limits. Actual usage can vary substantially by model, provider, canvas complexity, and reasoning behavior. The cost example below continues to use the typical `low` case: `10,000` input tokens and `1,000` output tokens. At standard short-context API rates, that would be:

- `gpt-5.6-sol`: `10,000 x $5.00 / 1M + 1,000 x $30.00 / 1M = $0.080`
- `gpt-5.6-terra`: `10,000 x $2.50 / 1M + 1,000 x $15.00 / 1M = $0.040`
- `gpt-5.6-luna`: `10,000 x $1.00 / 1M + 1,000 x $6.00 / 1M = $0.016`

At those example quantities, that is about 1.6 to 8 cents per request. Medium, `xhigh`, and `max` requests can cost more because their reasoning tokens are billed as output. Prices can change, so check the [OpenAI API pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing) page for current rates.

If you sign in to Codex with ChatGPT, PenEcho uses the Codex usage included with your plan instead of an API key. Included limits vary by plan, and additional usage may require ChatGPT credits. See [Codex pricing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pricing) for current plans and limits. Claude CLI mode similarly uses the account authenticated by Claude Code; it is distinct from Anthropic API billing.

## Safe deployment

PenEcho listens on `0.0.0.0:3888` by default so localhost and trusted-LAN access work immediately. Choose the deployment boundary that matches your executor:

- **Codex CLI and Claude CLI modes:** use them only on the local machine or a trusted, directly connected LAN. A valid request starts a local CLI process, so do not expose either mode directly to the public internet or an untrusted reverse proxy. Both work immediately from localhost and LAN addresses without a public-origin setting. PenEcho checks the Host, client network, exact Origin, process-lifetime session cookie, and JSON content type before launching the selected CLI. Each valid new request immediately supersedes the prior request; it never waits in a queue or returns a busy response.
- **API mode:** local, LAN, proxy, and remote requests are intentionally accepted without PenEcho-level Host or Origin restrictions. If you expose it publicly, place it behind HTTPS, authentication, rate limiting, and request-size controls. Keep the selected configuration file and provider keys private; credentials remain in the Node.js process and are never sent to browser code.

For either mode, keep debug artifacts and request tracing disabled in production unless you are actively diagnosing a problem, and never publish configuration files, logs, screenshots, or saved requests containing private content. When request recording is enabled in `Settings`, each valid AI request is stored under `~/.penecho/logs/requests` by default, including the source `atlas.png`, the outbound image, credential-redacted request body, raw and parsed responses, fallback details, and final status. The UI also displays this path and configures retention.

## Useful configuration

The configuration center writes these settings to `~/.penecho/config.env`, or to the file selected with `--config`:

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | Executor: `api`, `codex-cli`, or `claude-cli` |
| `AI_API_FORMAT` | API request format: `openai` (default example) or `anthropic` |
| `AI_API_URL` / `AI_API_KEY` | API endpoint and credential; used only in API mode |
| `AI_API_MODEL` | Model used in API mode |
| `AI_EFFORT` | Startup reasoning effort for the canvas control; the toolbar's `Configured` option preserves this value verbatim, including custom names, while an empty CLI value leaves the CLI default untouched; Anthropic API and Claude CLI support `none` (wire value `thinking.type=disabled`), while OpenAI sends `reasoning_effort=none`; explicit toolbar levels override this value per request without modifying the file |
| `AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Unified timeout for API, Codex CLI, and Claude CLI model attempts; default 180, allowed range 10–600 |
| `PENECHO_AI_IMAGE_FORMAT` | Image format sent to API, Codex CLI, and Claude CLI: `webp` (default) or `png` |
| `CODEX_CLI_MODEL` | Optional model override for Codex CLI mode |
| `CLAUDE_CLI_MODEL` | Optional alias or model-ID override for Claude CLI mode |
| `AUTO_AI_DELAY_SECONDS` | Initial delay before automatic recognition; the browser control can override it from 0 to 10 seconds |
| `PENECHO_REQUEST_TRACE` | Save local per-request image, outbound request, response, and outcome traces; disabled by default |
| `PENECHO_REQUEST_TRACE_LIMIT` | Number of local request traces retained, default 100 and maximum 1000 |
| `HOST` / `PORT` | Listening interface and port, default `0.0.0.0:3888` |

For installed CLI starts, `--model` overrides the selected executor's model setting and `--effort` overrides `AI_EFFORT` for that process only. Command-line options and process environment variables take precedence over the selected configuration file.

Run the checks before submitting a change:

```bash
npm run check
```

For implementation details, see the [architecture notes](docs/architecture.md).

## Build it with us

PenEcho is young and built in the open. The problems that matter most — handwriting recognition, on-canvas visual tools, wider model support, and natural pen interaction — are still open, and you do not need to write code to help move them forward.

Ways to help:

- **Use it and share what happened.** A canvas that worked well, or one that fell apart, tells us more than any benchmark. A screenshot with secrets removed is enough.
- **Test a model.** PenEcho supports model selection independently for API, Codex CLI, and Claude CLI execution, and behavior still varies by model. Report the executor, model ID, effort, rough latency, and a sample result. Google/Gemini models are still untested and especially welcome.
- **Report rough edges.** Recognition misses, layout glitches, and awkward pen behavior are all worth an issue, however small. For model-specific issues, include a reproducible canvas example and expected and actual results.
- **Write code.** Recognition, visual tools, model adapters, and pen input each have room to grow. `npm run check` runs the full suite before you open a pull request.
- **Help more people read it.** The UI ships English and Chinese today; more translations and clearer docs are welcome.

Where to talk:

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/3jrPJ3mXdX) — real-time discussion, model-testing notes, and shared canvas workflows. New faces and works-in-progress are always welcome.
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/penecho/penecho/discussions) — ideas and questions worth keeping searchable.
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/penecho/penecho/issues) — reproducible bugs and confirmed work.

New contributors start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). If PenEcho clicks for you, star the repo and share the demo — that visibility is what brings the next person in.
